# 🏙 Municipal Services Web Application

## 📖 Project Description

The *Municipal Services App* is a comprehensive ASP.NET MVC web platform designed for residents and municipal administrators to interact efficiently.  
It provides an all-in-one solution for *reporting local issues, **tracking service requests, **viewing local events, and **reading announcements* — promoting community transparency and smart city governance.

Built with *ASP.NET Core MVC, **Entity Framework Core, and **Bootstrap 5, this system leverages **advanced data structures* — such as *Binary Search Trees (BSTs), **Heaps, and **Graphs* — to organize, manage, and optimize service request tracking.

## ⚙ How It Works

### 🧾 Service Request Tracking (Part 3)
- Each report is assigned a unique *Request Reference (MS-xxxx)*.  
- A *Binary Search Tree (BST)* is used for fast lookup by reference.  
- A *Priority Queue* (min-heap) prioritizes older requests for admin attention.  
- A *Graph Structure* links related issues by location.  
- A *Dictionary* organizes requests by category for quick filtering.  
- Admins can update statuses, and history logs are recorded for transparency.

### 📅 Local Events & Announcements
- Events and announcements are loaded from the database and displayed with dynamic filters.
- Users can search and filter by *keyword, **category, or **date range*.
- A smart recommendation engine analyzes recent searches and suggests similar events.

### 🔐 Authentication
- Secure *Admin Login* using credentials stored in configuration (appsettings.json).
- Unauthorized users are redirected to an *Access Denied* view.
- Session-based authentication ensures controlled admin access.

🧮 Data Structure Responsibilities
| Structure                                 | Purpose                    |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `Queue<string>`                           | Stores recent search terms |
| `PriorityQueue<Event, DateTime>`          | Manages upcoming events    |
| `Stack<Action>`                           | Handles undo operations    |
| `Dictionary<string, List<Event>>`         | Categorizes events         |
| `HashSet<string>`                         | Keeps categories unique    |
| `SortedDictionary<DateTime, List<Event>>` | Groups events by date      |

---

🧠 Example Flow

1. User searches for “Youth Events”.

2. Search term is added to the Queue and stored in searchCounts.

3. Recommendations update automatically based on frequency.

4. Events are displayed using SortedDictionary (by date) and Dictionary (by category).

5. Reports can be submitted anytime using the ReportController.
